# Fireside Reviews

Fireside Reviews is a role-based performance review system built with:

- Next.js (App Router)
- Supabase (Postgres + RLS + RPC)
- Database-enforced workflow rules
- Role-gated release semantics
- Warm Fireside design system

This system is **database-authoritative**.  
All workflow locking, release logic, scoring, and visibility rules are enforced in Postgres.

The frontend mirrors database state. It does not define it.

# Current Status

## UI

- Reviews page layout finalized and stable
- Left navigation restored
- Warm Fireside theme locked
- Reviewer scoring UI working
- Submission locking reflected correctly
- Admin share-with-employee toggle wired
- Toggle no longer full-page refresh
- Toggle optimistic update implemented
- Employee summary view functional
- Admin UI wiring in progress

## Backend

- Schema stable
- `summary_admin_private` permanently removed
- Narrative model unified to:
  - `summary_employee_visible`
- Share flag:
  - `narrative_share_with_employee` (boolean on `reviews`)
- Submission locking enforced in DB
- Per-employee per-cycle release enforced
- Types regenerated and consolidated to:
  - `lib/database.types.ts`
- No duplicate generated types remain

---

# Design Theme

Fireside design principles:

- Warm neutral base: `#fbf4ec`
- Soft card layers: `#fff7f0`, `#fffdfb`
- Rounded corners (`rounded-2xl`)
- Subtle shadow (`shadow-sm`)
- Minimal harsh white
- Content-dominant layout
- Clean badge system
- No unnecessary chrome

The Reviews page layout is considered stable.

# Architecture Overview

Frontend (Next.js App Router)
        ↓
Route Handlers / Server Components
        ↓
Supabase Postgres
  - Tables
  - RLS Policies
  - Triggers
  - SQL Functions

Database is the source of truth.

Frontend never decides:
- Visibility

# Core Data Model

## Job Roles

- Fully data-driven
- Referenced by UUID
- Never hardcoded
- Editable by admin

## Employees

- Linked to `job_roles`
- `employee_code` generated via SQL trigger
- No PII stored in employee table

## Review Assignments

Generated per cycle.

reviewer_type:
- primary
- secondary
- peer
- self

---

# Narrative Model (Updated)

Narrative is unified.

`reviews` table now contains:

- `summary_employee_visible` (text)
- `narrative_share_with_employee` (boolean)

Removed permanently:
- `summary_admin_private`

There is no longer a dual-narrative model.

---

# Review Workflow

1. Admin creates cycle
2. Admin assigns rubrics per job role
3. Assignments generated
4. Reviewers submit narrative
5. Primary reviewer submits scores
6. Admin optionally toggles narrative visibility
7. Admin releases employee (per employee per cycle)
8. Employee sees public summary

---

# Share-With-Employee Toggle

API route:
app/api/reviews/[assignmentId]/share-narrative/route.ts


Server-side guards:

- Review must be `submitted`
- Cycle must not be released for employee
- Caller must be admin

Column updated:
reviews.narrative_share_with_employee


UI:
- Optimistic toggle
- No full-page refresh
- Disabled when:
  - Not admin
  - Review not submitted
  - Employee already released

---

# Submission Locking (DB Enforced)

When:

reviews.status = 'submitted'


- Narrative immutable
- Scores immutable
- Only `admin_reopen_review` RPC unlocks
- Enforced via triggers

UI controls are advisory only.

---

# Release Model (Authoritative)

RPC:

admin_release_employee_cycle(cycle_id uuid, employee_id uuid)


Function behavior:

- Sets `released_at`
- Computes performance rating
- Writes audit_log
- Idempotent
- SECURITY DEFINER
- Admin-gated

Employees never read raw review tables.

They read only:

cycle_employee_summary_public


Guarded by:

released_at IS NOT NULL


---
---

# Release Guard Validation (System Confirmed)

During Feb cycle validation, we confirmed:

- `admin_release_employee_cycle` correctly sets:
  - `released_at`
  - `released_by`
  - `performance_rating_value`
- Release is idempotent
- Employee visibility is gated strictly by:
  - `cycle_employee_summary_public.released_at`
- Employee page reads from:
  - `cycle_employee_summary_public.final_narrative_employee_visible`
- Employee page does **NOT** read from:
  - `reviews.summary_employee_visible`
- Reviewer inbox badges correctly reflect `released_at`
- RLS policies verified and stable

Validation performed via:
- Authenticated debug route
- Direct Postgres queries
- UI login validation as employee

No additional RLS modifications required.

---

# Narrative + Release Integrity

End-to-end workflow confirmed:

1. Reviewer submits narrative  
2. Reviewer commits review  
3. Admin releases employee (per employee per cycle)  
4. Employee sees:
   - Primary narrative  
   - Secondary narrative (if committed)  
   - Only after release  
5. Release badge reflects correct state

There are no remaining dual-narrative remnants.

---

# Release RPC Behavior

RPC:

`admin_release_employee_cycle(cycle_id uuid, employee_id uuid)`

Current behavior:

- Requires existing `cycle_employee_summary_public` row  
- Throws if missing  
- Sets `released_at` and `released_by`  
- Computes `performance_rating_value`  
- Writes to `audit_log`  
- Is idempotent  
- SECURITY DEFINER  
- Admin-gated  

Future optional hardening:

- Add upsert guard to create summary row if missing  
- Not required for current system stability  

---

# RLS State (Verified Stable)

Confirmed policies:

Employees can select:

employee_id = auth.uid()
AND finalized_at IS NOT NULL

---
# Visibility Rules (Non-Negotiable)

| Role             | Can See                          |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Primary Reviewer | Assigned reviews + scoring        |
| Peer/Secondary   | Narrative only                    |
| Employee         | Public summary only               |
| Admin            | Everything                        |

Enforced by Postgres RLS.

---

# Active Cycle (Global)

Stored in:

public.app_settings
key = 'active_cycle_id'


Resolution order:

1. `?cycleId=` override (admin only, open cycles only)
2. app_settings value
3. First open calibrating cycle

All pages must use shared resolver logic.

---

# Supabase Clients

## Server Client

lib/supabaseServer.ts

Used in:
- Server Components
- Route Handlers
- RPC calls

## Browser Client

lib/supabaseClient.ts

Used in:
- `"use client"` components only

---

# Types (Single Source)

Generated types location:

lib/database.types.ts


Regenerate after schema changes:

npx supabase gen types typescript --local > lib/database.types.ts


There must be no duplicate generated type files.

---

# Schema Snapshot

Export snapshot:

npx supabase db dump --schema public --file schema.sql


`schema.sql` is read-only snapshot.

Never treat as migration.

---

# DB Invariants (Do Not Break Without Migration)

- RLS policies
- Review status semantics
- Rubric category codes
- Score-to-rating mapping
- Audit logging schema
- Release semantics
- Employee visibility rules
- FK relationships
- Trigger logic

All DB changes must be incremental migrations.

Never modify production schema manually.

---

# Developer Rules

- No long prefaces
- Prefer copy/paste precision
- Do not break working surfaces
- Ask before refactoring stable code
- Design forward
- Avoid rabbit holes
- Smallest viable change first
- Never duplicate generated types
- Never regenerate types to a different path without updating imports
> Tip: when using `grep`, always exclude generated folders (`node_modules`, `.next`, `.git`) or results will be noisy.
- Note: Git Bash on Windows does not include `rg` (ripgrep) by default — use `grep -RIn --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.next "pattern" .` instead.
---

# Local Development Notes

- Supabase CLI manages migrations
- SQL editor bypasses RLS
- UI respects RLS
- Regenerate types after schema changes
- Regenerate schema snapshot only when exporting baseline

---

# Important Testing Rule

When running SQL that depends on `auth.uid()` or RLS:

Prepend:

select set_config('request.jwt.claim.sub', '<uuid>', true);
select set_config('request.jwt.claim.role', 'authenticated', true);


Run in same SQL batch.

3. Confirm review for Yemi is still `submitted`
4. Confirm Delia can:
   - Toggle narrative (if not released)
   - Release employee cycle
   - Access admin routes
