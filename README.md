# Fireside-Reviews
Fireside Reviews is a role-based performance review system built with **Next.js (App Router)** and **Supabase**.  It supports structured review cycles, **job-family–specific performance standards**, controlled visibility of ratings, and admin-managed workflows, with business rules enforced **in Postgres**, not the frontend.
